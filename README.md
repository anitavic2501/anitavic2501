### 
👋🏼 Hi there ! Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I am Anita, Business Intelligence Developer/Data Analyst based in Auckland, New Zealand! 

📌 I am interested in cloud-based data engineering and am currently learning Azure Synapse.

📌 My expertise lies in end-to-end BI solution architecture from data extraction, ETL, data modelling, data warehouse and visualisation, and my skills include SQL, MS BI suite (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS), Power BI, and dimensional modelling, etc.

<!--📌 BI Solution delivery:

Step 1: Case Analysis (4W+1H) to clarify business needs and requirements
Who needs to see the dashboard? -> Target audience group(s)
What are the key metrics? -> Facts (median value/crime rate/rental)
When does the team want to see it? -> yearly reports?
Where does the team want to see it? -> Which state?
How they want to see it (e.g. by state/by school/by station) -> dimensions
Step 2: Standardise data ETL/ELT process using SSIS packages and SQL to meet business requirements.
Step 3: Designing star-schema dimensional data models following Kimball methodologies to display relationships between dimensions and facts.
Step 4: Creating a bus matrix, identifying conformed dimensions.
Step 5: Designing data warehouses and data marts for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Step 6: Develop dashboards & paginated reports with Power BI/SSRS for end-user accessibility, providing meaningful insights in a storytelling manner.
